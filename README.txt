What will this module do?
-------------------------
This module will take images that are embedded (copy/paste) or were uploaded via the wysiwyg and attach them to an image field.

Why?
----

This will allow the user to use images that were embedded or placed in the WYSIWYG in a photo gallery, teaser image, or any other way that fieldable images are commonly used.

Steps to configure
------------------
1. Enable the module
2. Go the the modules configuration page (/admin/config/content/inline_image_to_field)
3. Set whichever fields to use for each content type

Other Notes
-----------
1. This currently only applies to the 'Node' entity type
2. If you have specified a different folder for inline images then the drupal default, this will not work properly.
